# hifren - a tryout with instant messaging

This project is intended as my personal C\# showcase, and also as a demo for a chat client/server. It's still in a very early phase, and maturation should be expected over the next year.

Thanks for HiQ Finland's IEX team for providing the project day, where to develop this, and for the ZeroMQ community for their neat networking library.
